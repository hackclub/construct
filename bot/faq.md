What is construct ?
-------------------

Construct is a ysws (you ship we ship)\
The aim of the game is simple, you ship cad designs, and we'll ship you a 3d printer!

Who runs this?
--------------

Our team is led by a crew of 7 people. They've worked around the clock to help make this ysws come to life!

FAQ:
====

When does this program end?
---------------------------

This program ends on 15th Feb, so remember to submit your project before the end!

How can I earn Bricks/Clay?
---------------------------

for every hour you work and journal, you shall receive 1 bag of clay!\
After you buy a base 3D printer, you will start receiving bricks! 10 per hour! Bricks can be used to buy items in the Brick Shop! They can also be used to upgrade your printer.\
If you don't wish to buy a 3D printer, you may convert your clay bag to bricks. This is done by Ovenpheus at a rate of 9 bricks for 1 bag of clay, upon request. You will continue to still earn clay bags which you can still convert. (This is in place in case you want to change your mind in the near future)\
Alternatively, when you buy a base 3D printer, you won't need the help of Ovenpheus as you'll get a free - super cool - Firing Oven 2000 :tm: : which converts your bags of clay automatically at the rate of 10 bricks for every 1 bag of clay.

How many projects can I make?
-----------------------------

You can make as many projects as you like! Please refrain from copying other projects 1:1.

What can I make?
----------------

You can make anything 3d modelled as long as it is good quality! It must be cad, or something printable.

What is this new journaling system? / How do I journal?
-------------------------------------------------------

This is a system designed by [@user](https://slack.com/team/U0929F6RWL9) and made by [@user](https://slack.com/team/U09192704Q7).\
This system of journaling is designed to prevent the misuse of hour inflation.\
Journal logs are capped at 2 hours, regardless of how long you spent on that journal. You cannot spam 2 hour logs continuously. The time between from one journal to the next is recorded, and you may only journal on what time has elapsed since your last journal. (Only applicable if less then two hours have elapsed since last journal)\
If you lose hours on your work, then there's nothing we can do, if we give you extra minutes/hours then there isn't any point in having a journaling system like this.

Does Construct allow group projects?
------------------------------------

For now, we are not allowing group projects

Can I continue working on existing project?
-------------------------------------------

Yes! Although we will only count the hours starting from the start date of construct!

Do I have to build my project?
------------------------------

This is slightly complicated. You will need to have it on [printables.com](http://printables.com) but you'll need to have a make there (Have a physically printed image). The make can be printed from someone on printables or you can print it if you have a 3d printer. Alternatively, you can have us print it and send an image to you for a small cut of your earnings! If we print it for you, you won't get it shipped to your house.

What happens if I commit the act of hour inflation (fraud)?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Hour inflation is not tolerated in hack club, or in any of its sponsored programs.\
If you are caught commuting hour inflation (fraud) then you will be banned from this ysws, and all current and future ysws, for an indefinite amount of time.\
If you believe you have been banned unfairly, please dm [@user](https://slack.com/team/U091HC53CE8). This is the only way you can appeal.\
If you get unbanned, after frauding, then you will lose all your currency and all your projects will be deleted.\
If we have made an error, then it will be overturned with no loss in currency.\
Please do not fraud as it takes attention away from people who truly work honestly.

When's the last submission date?
--------------------------------

The last submission date is Sunday, the 1st of February, at 11:59 PM Eastern standard time.\
Journalling will be disabled on Saturday, 31st January, 2026. 11:59PM EST\
New project making will be disabled on Friday, 30th January, 2026. 11:59PM EST.\
Both shops close on Sunday, 15th of February, 2026, 11:59PM EST. Currency beyond this point will be destroyed.

How will fulfilment take place?
-------------------------------

Most fulfilment will happen via website. You will be notified when your item is fulfilled.\
In the event, if your item is wayyy overpriced. You will be dmed by someone to either:

A. Be asked to give us a link on what thing we should buy for you, on your behalf (for high priced items)\
Or\
B. Be given a grant to buy the item yourself (for more, lower priced items)\
Or\
C. Be given a refund on your currency.

There is an option to get your own 3d printer. The price of the printer can be anywhere from $180 dollars (will be 200 dollars if you don't have any other options to choose from) to an indefinite amount!\
Note: if you spend your grant for anything other then the given purpose, we will ask for the full amount you owe us, and if not repaid by the end of deadline, you will be banned from construct and will face further repercussions.\
Please don't buy McDonald's and Nike's :hdheavysob:
